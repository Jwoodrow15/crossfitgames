# crossfitgames

`{crossfitgames}` provides high-level functionality for retrieving data from the Crossfit Games API. It also provides some lower-level functionality for making requests to this API (if users prefer this level of access) as well as helper functions for accessing, reshaping, and cleaning data retrieved from the API.

## Installation

You can install the development version from Github via:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes") if not already installed
remotes::install_github("ekholme/crossfitgames")
```

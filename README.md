`{crossfitgames}` provides high-level functionality for retrieving data
from the Crossfit Games API. It also provides some lower-level
functionality for making requests to this API (if users prefer this
level of access) as well as helper functions for accessing, reshaping,
and cleaning data retrieved from the API.

## Installation

``` r
#install.packages("remotes") if not already installed
remotes::install_github("ekholme/crossfitgames")
